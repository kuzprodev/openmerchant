              REFUND, TERMINATION AND CANCELLATION POLICY
              </br>
              </br>
              Termination
              </br>
              At any time rendering of the domain name purchase service (“Service”)
               may be terminated by Openmerchant, Inc. (“Termination”) upon
               notification of the client by electronic mail or by phone.
              </br>
              Refunds
              </br>
              Openmerchant, Inc. shall return all the payments, remitted by the
              clients and received by Openmerchant, Inc. until its termination
              of Service subject to the some restrictions applicable, e.g.:
              </br>
              no refund is available if the termination of Service was due to
              material breach by the client of the privacy/proxy agreement or
              other ICANN policies and regulations (such as willful provision of
              inaccurate or unreliable information; willful failure to update
              information provided to Openmerchant, Inc. and/or other violations
              of the ICANN Registrar Accreditation agreement including WHOis
              accuracy program specification, Specification on privacy and proxy
              registrations (after the latter comes into force));
              a refund may be delayed for the time reasonably necessary in sole
              discretion of Openmerchant, Inc. to investigate the cause for
              cancellation or termination of the Service.
              Should a refund be effectuated by Openmerchant, Inc., all chargebacks
               will be credited to the credit card, debit card, or checking account
               used in the original transaction exclusively, provided that all the
               service fees and commissions, imposed by the banks, payment services
               and etc. shall be borne by the client.
              </br>
              All refund requests must be made by the client who initiated the
              domain name purchase transaction and contain the full name of the
              client, transaction number and other details which may serve to
              identify the client as may be reasonably requested by Openmerchant, Inc.
              </br>
              Cancellation
              </br>
              Any client, utilizing the Service, may cancel the domain purchase
              request UNTIL the domain name was transferred to the Client
              (“Cancellation”) subject to some exceptions apply:
              </br>
              client is eligible for Cancellation past the domain name transfer
              in case if he provides documentary evidence that the transaction
              was due to unauthorized or fraudulent use of his credit or debit
              card or checking account;
              cancellation request is accompanied with the payment of the penalty
               fee in the amount of 300 USD.
              </br>
              </br>
              DEBITING TIME OF CLIENT
              </br>
              </br>
              As a matter of general rule, the client is eligible for instantaneous
               servicing after accepting the terms and conditions of this site and
               successful completion of the domain purchase procedure at:
               </br>
                <a href="#">http://openmerchant.com/transfer.html</a>
                . But in some instances
                Openmerchant, Inc. reserves the right to take a time for running
                the test of the contact details and other information, provided
                by the client for closure up a transaction (not to exceed 5 business day overall).
              </br>
              If you need a copy of transaction data/receipt
              </br>
              All clients may request in writing a copy of the transaction
              data/receipt of payments/charges as a consideration for the Service.
              Such a request should be sent to the site support team at:
              </br>
              <a href="#">http://openmerchant.com/contactus.html</a>
               and regularly is responded
               within 2 business days. The client foregoes this right if such
               request is not duly made.
              Business hours for handling the copy of transaction data/receipt
              requests: 11:00 to 17:00 Central European Time.</p>
