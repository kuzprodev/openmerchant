               Purchasing a domain name is easy. Just contact us, and we will inform you how
               to make a one-time payment in USD (major credit cards are accepted).
               As soon as your payment is processed, you will receive an e-mail,
               which contains your password and a link to the Registrar domain management area.
               After you log in, please enter your ownership and contact information and
               generate a new password. After that the transfer is over. If you have already
               set up your hosting, you can also input your DNS information and start using
               the domain name as a website. Otherwise, you can update it anytime later.
               Domain name rights are transferred to you on the permanent basis, you are only
               responsible for renewal fees. You can either stay with the current Registrar
               or move to some other Registar you prefer.</p>

              Legal matters</br>
              Openmerchant does not own domain names put for sale at our marketplace.
              To all domain owners that wish to keep their personal information private,
              we offer privacy services (including WHOIS privacy). Due to this procedure the
              clients' whois records will be modified and the owner field will be substituted
              by "Openmerchant, by proxy and reseller agreement 2007-gen-PR" record and the owners'
               contact data will be replaced by Openmerchat contacts. If you think that your
               rights are violated by a domain owner that uses our whois privacy service,
               please contact us at domains (at) openmerchant.com. Please, provide the documentary
               evidence of a violation (e. g. a trademark certificate). Do not forget to mention
               the domain name in issue. Upon a prima facie case, we usually suspend the proxy
               and reseller agreement with the domain owner and restore the owner's contact details in the whois record.</p>
